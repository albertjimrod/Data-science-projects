## Predicting Car Prices using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. 


Exploring the fundamentals of machine learning to predict a car's market price using its attributes.

For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as:

- the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more.


The data set here and can download it directly from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile)

the challenges I have encountered have been several:

- Finding out what I need to do to read the data file.
- Do a good data cleansing, and discover NaN values when the.info method tells us that all columns are fine.
- create a mind map to see the relationship between the different functions, so that it is easier to see the relationships between the different functions and how I can reuse them or if they have been modified.

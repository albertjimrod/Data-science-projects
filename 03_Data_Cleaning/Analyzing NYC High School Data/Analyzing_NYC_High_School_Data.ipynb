    "# Data Cleaning Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science projects usually consist of one of two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **exploration and analysis of a set of data**. One example might involve analyzing donors to political campaigns, creating a plot, and then sharing an analysis of the plot with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **operational system that generates predictions based on data that updates continually**. An algorithm that pulls in daily stock ticker data and predicts which stock prices rise and fall would be one example.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This project walk throught the first part of a complete data science project, how to adquire raw data and exploring and analyzing a dataset, combining several messy data sets into a single one to make the analysis easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to decide on a topic, two ways to find a good topic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think about what sectors or angles you're really interested in, then find data sets relating to those sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Review several datasets and find one that seems interesting enough to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "A point to start migh be:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><a href=\"https://www.data.gov\" target=\"_blank\">Data.gov</a> - A directory of government data downloads</li>\n",

    "\n",
    "### New York City public schools\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "you'll want to to choose an angle to investigate that has enough depth to analyze but isn't so complicated that it's difficult to get started. You want to finish the project and your results to be interesting to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### angle to investigate:\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests and whether they're unfair to certain groups. Given our prior knowledge of this topic, investigating the correlations between SAT scores and demographics might be an interesting angle to take. We could correlate SAT scores with factors like race, gender, income, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test**: Is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's important to perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points (while this number has changed a few times, the dataset for our project is based on 2,400 total points). Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is necessary to know the SAT scores and demographic data associated with those scores\n",

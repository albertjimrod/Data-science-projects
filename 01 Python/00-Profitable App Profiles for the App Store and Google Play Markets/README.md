# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets


## Project Description.

We're working as data analysts for a company that builds free Android and free iOS mobile apps, our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the number of users of our apps determines our revenue for any given app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better. 

Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.
